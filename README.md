# Delete_duplicates

This Python script can remove duplicate files in a directory, even if they have different names. It uses the os and hashlib libraries to calculate the hash of each file and then compares them to identify and delete the duplicates.

# Usage
To use this script, you need to modify the folder_path variable to point to the directory where your files are located. Then you can run the script and it will automatically delete any duplicate files it finds.
